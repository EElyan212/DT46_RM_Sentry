[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:172 (add_dependencies):
  Cannot add target-level dependencies to non-existent target
  "livox_ros_driver2".

  The add_dependencies works for top-level logical targets created by the
  add_executable, add_library, or add_custom_target commands.  If you want to
  add file-level dependencies see the DEPENDS option of the add_custom_target
  and add_custom_command commands.

  The plain signature for target_link_libraries has already been used with
  the target "livox_ros_driver2".  All uses of target_link_libraries with a
  target must be either all-keyword or all-plain.

  The uses of the plain signature are here:
